# Data-structure-and-Algorithm-TO-DO-LIST
A simple command-line To-Do List Manager built using C++ and linked lists. This project allows users to efficiently manage daily tasks with features like adding, viewing, sorting by priority (time), and marking tasks as completed — all from a clean text-based menu interface. It uses Linked List to perform these tasks. 
To-Do List in C++ 🥇

This is a simple command-line To-Do List program made using C++.
It helps you keep track of your daily tasks by adding, viewing, sorting, and marking them as completed.
I made this project to practice linked lists, classes, and basic data structures in C++.

Features 🔢

Add a new task with a specific time (hour and minute)
View all tasks in the order they were added
Display a priority list sorted by time
Mark tasks as completed (removes them from the list)
Handles memory efficiently using dynamic allocation and destructors

What I Used / Learned 💯

Classes and Objects in C++
Singly Linked List
Dynamic memory handling (new and delete)
STL containers (vector, pair)
Sorting using std::sort with lambda functions
Simple menu-driven console interface

Possible Improvements 👍

Save and load tasks using file handling
Add input validation for time format
Option to edit existing tasks
Add task priority levels (High / Medium / Low)
Keep a record of completed tasks
