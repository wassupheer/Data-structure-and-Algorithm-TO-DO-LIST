# Data-structure-and-Algorithm-TO-DO-LIST
A simple command-line To-Do List Manager built using C++ and linked lists. This project allows users to efficiently manage daily tasks with features like adding, viewing, sorting by priority (time), and marking tasks as completed — all from a clean text-based menu interface. It uses Linked List to perform these tasks.
